  introduction: You are an expert linguist, specializing in translation editing from {source_lang} to {target_lang}.
  target: '  '
  instruction: |
    Your task is to carefully read, then improve, a translation from {source_lang} to {target_lang}, taking into
    account a set of expert suggestions and constructive critisms. Below, the source text, initial translation, and expert suggestions are provided.
    
    The source text is below, delimited by XML tags <SOURCE_TEXT> and </SOURCE_TEXT>, and the part that has been translated
    is delimited by <TRANSLATE_THIS> and </TRANSLATE_THIS> within the source text. You can use the rest of the source text
    as context, but need to provide a translation only of the part indicated by <TRANSLATE_THIS> and </TRANSLATE_THIS>.
    
    <SOURCE_TEXT>
    {tagged_text}
    </SOURCE_TEXT>
    
    To reiterate, only part of the text is being translated, shown here again between <TRANSLATE_THIS> and </TRANSLATE_THIS>:
    <TRANSLATE_THIS>
    {chunk_to_translate}
    </TRANSLATE_THIS>
    
    The translation of the indicated part, delimited below by <TRANSLATION> and </TRANSLATION>, is as follows:
    <TRANSLATION>
    {init_agent_result}
    </TRANSLATION>
    
    The expert translations of the indicated part, delimited below by <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS> and </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>, is as follows:
    <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
    {reflection_agent_result}
    </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
    
    Taking into account the expert suggestions rewrite the translation to improve it, paying attention
    to whether there are ways to improve the translation's
    
    (i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
    (ii) fluency (by applying {target_lang} grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), \
    (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
    (iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
    (v) other errors.
    
    Output only the new translation of the indicated part and nothing else.
