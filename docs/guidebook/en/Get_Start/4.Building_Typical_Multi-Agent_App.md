# Preface
In the chapter "Quick Guide to Building Single Agent", we have quickly built and operated a single agent. In this chapter, we will further break it down into multiple agents that collaborate with each other.

# Single Agent to Multi-Agent
Demo Path：[demo_startup_app_with_multi_agents](../../../../examples/startup_app/demo_startup_app_with_multi_agents)

n more complex scenarios, a single agent may not be sufficient to complete the task. We need multi-agent collaboration.

Taking the sample project of pet insurance Q&A as an example, users' questions may be quite varied, and sometimes the responses from a single agent can deviate from the topic. Driven by the expertise of certain specialists, we have divided this scenario into three agents: planning, executing, and expressing. We will then use the pet insurance consulting agent to connect them together.


## Sub-Agent
Using the experiences gained from building a single agent, we separately establish three agents for planning, executing, and expressing.

Planning Agent (Break down complex problems into manageable steps):
[pet_question_rewrite_agent.yaml](../../../../examples/startup_app/demo_startup_app_with_multi_agents/intelligence/agentic/agent/agent_instance/pet_insurance_planning_agent.yaml)


Executing Agent:
[pet_question_planning_agent.yaml](../../../../examples/startup_app/demo_startup_app_with_multi_agents/intelligence/agentic/agent/agent_instance/pet_insurance_executing_agent.yaml)

Expressing Agent:
[pet_insurance_expressing_agent.yaml](../../../../examples/startup_app/demo_startup_app_with_multi_agents/intelligence/agentic/agent/agent_instance/pet_insurance_expressing_agent.yaml)

## Master-Agent
[pet_insurance_consult_agent.yaml](../../../../examples/startup_app/demo_startup_app_with_multi_agents/intelligence/agentic/agent/agent_instance/pet_insurance_consult_agent.yaml)

The main agent connects several agents and tools in a logical sequence. It is important to pay attention to parameter passing; the agent_input serves as the thread context to store intermediate results for use by subsequent agents. The input and output fields of each agent can be customized according to requirements, and it is recommended to avoid duplication.

## Running Tests

Run [pet_insurance_consult_pro_agent_test.py](../../../../examples/startup_app/demo_startup_app_with_multi_agents/intelligence/test/pet_insurance_multi_agent_test.py)

**The final execution result of the pet insurance consultation agent:**

```text
宠物医保在保障期间内不支持从基础版升级到升级版或尊享版。您如果希望获得更高版本的保障，可以在当前保单到期后，在续保时选择升级到所需的版本。
请注意，续保时的保费可能会根据宠物的当前状况和保险公司的评估有所调整。
