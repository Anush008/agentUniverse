    # you can change this config to a customized LLM
    # e.g. demo_llm, which defined in /intelligence/agentic/llm/demo_llm.yaml
    #
    # The `name` field specifies the LLM to be used by the agent.
    # - In this configuration, the `@FUNC` annotation is used to dynamically determine the LLM name at runtime.
    # - The `@FUNC` syntax allows users to call a custom function, in this case, `get_llm_by_agent_id`,
    #   which is defined in the `CustomizedFuncUtil` class within the `customized_func_util.py` file.
    # - When the application loads this YAML configuration, agentUniverse will parse the `@FUNC` annotation,
    #   execute the `get_llm_by_agent_id` function with the provided argument (`"demo_agent"`),
    #   and replace the annotation with the function's return value.
